# ABankTellerGUI

Built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java, JavaFX, Scenebuilder, inheritance, and polymorphism.

It handles banking transactions such as opening an account, closing an account, depositing into an account, withdrawing from an account, and printing
all accounts in the database in four different ways.

Handles all types errors such as not including enough information for a transaction process, inputting invalid information, attempting to print an empty database,
closing an already closed account, and more.

To use the GUI, run the Java class named "BankTellerMain" in the src folder.
